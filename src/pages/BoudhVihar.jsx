      <span className='font-extrabold underline decoration-2'>Buddhism </span> is one of the major religions in the world. With its philosophy founded in northeastern India, the religion is based on <span className='font-extrabold underline decoration-2'>the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama</span>, known as the Buddha. Among many important aspects of Buddhism, Monasticism is one of the most fundamental institutions in Buddhism. The residing <span className='text-red-600'>monks</span> and nuns in the monasteries are more than responsible for preserving and spreading the Buddhist teachings. The monasteries house these monks and nuns as well as educate and guide them so as for them to do so with the other Buddhist followers. Known with many names among the followers of Buddhism depending upon the region, the monasteries are called as <span className='font-extrabold'>Gumba, Gonpa, Viharas, Dzongpa,</span> etc among the followers of various countries. The origins of <span className='font-extrabold underline decoration-2'>Buddhist monasteries</span> are thought to have emerged from the practice of <span className='font-extrabold'>Vassa</span>, the retreat undertaken by the <span className='font-extrabold'>Buddhist monks </span> and nuns of South Asian reason during the rainy season. These vassas later developed into Monasteries which turned into centers of learning, and the philosophical principles of <span className='font-extrabold'>Buddhism</span> were developed and discussed. Here is the list of top 10 most famous and unique <span className='font-extrabold'>Buddhist monasteries</span>all over the world.

This Marvelously built temple was constructed 1400 years ago and is one of the shining examples of extraordinary architectural merits.
